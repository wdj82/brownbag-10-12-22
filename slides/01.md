# What is State?

## Client State vs Server State

Most state problems are synchronizing server data with the client.

Try and think of server state as state your app does not own. It is borrowing the most recent version from the server to display it on the screen. The server owns the data.

Using apps like React Query let you display a cached version of that data while fetching the newest version in the background. The user doesn't have to see a loading spinner for every fetch, and the data updates with the latest version to again show the latest version from the server.
